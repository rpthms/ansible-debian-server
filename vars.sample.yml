#
# openvpn_port is the port at which the OpenVPN server will be
# listening on
# openvpn_ipv4_network and openvpn_ipv6_network are the subnets
# that will be used by the server and the connecting clients.
#
# THE FOLLOWING PART IS OPTIONAL. You can delete the openvpn_ipv4_routes and
# openvpn_ipv6_routes variables if you're not going to use them.
#
# If you want the VPN users to be able to connect to the networks/LANs
# behind certain VPN clients, then add those networks to the openvpn_ipv4_network
# and openvpn_ipv6_network lists. You need to specify those routes and the common 
# name of the clients through which you can reach them.

# want to add extra static IPv6 addresses to your server's interface,
# add them to the static_ipv6 list below.
