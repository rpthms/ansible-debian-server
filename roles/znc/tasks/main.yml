# If zncd is not a system user, then journald will store the logs from the zncd
# user in a separate journal file (Check /var/log/journal). This file won't be
# readable even if you're a member of the systemd-journal group. You will need
# to be root to view the logs from the journal files of users other than your
# own. A system user will send it's logs to the system log and not a separate
# user journal, and therefore will be readable by members of the
# systemd-journal group.
