#
# There's a bug in OpenVPN where the internal IPv6 routes of a client
# are also getting pushed to that client
# Until that get's fixed we'll have assign a slightly smaller IPv6 prefix
# than the actual prefix. That way, even though the internal prefix is pushed
# to the client, the client will acutally follow the route with the larger
# prefix ( which would be the more specific route ). Eg:- pushing a /63
# route wouldn't matter if the interal route is a /64.
#
# This workaround was suggested in the following Bug link:
# https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/354
